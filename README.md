**Python-for-everybody---Coursera**
**Coursera courses for the Python for Everybody Specialization (by the University of Michigan).**

Very good introduction to basic programming. Very easy for beginners in python who have already some programming background - but still extremely useful to quickly and efficiently learn python basics.
